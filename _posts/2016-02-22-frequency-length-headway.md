Frequency is a crucially important factor in the usefulness of transit. Generally speaking, "more is better" when it comes to how often transit runs. But running more service also costs more money. Yet running more service can also attract more ridership, which may help pay for the cost of providing that service. It's a complex relationship.

One key question when figuring out how often to run a transit service is figuring out how often is "necessary" --- meaning, what is the minimum frequency needed to attract a sizeable portion of the potential ridership? Thus we stumble among the tight relationship between three key variables:

- *Trip frequency:* how often a person takes a certain (type of) trip
- *Trip length:* how far a person is traveling
- *Service headway:* the number of minutes between buses/trains; note that a higher headway means a lower frequency

Each influences the other two. Let's take a look at 




freq len

Generally speaking, we can assume that people like to minimize the total amount of time they spend getting from place to place. That time roughly depends on multiplying the length of different types of trips by how often a person makes those trips. As a result, people take shorter trips more often and longer trips less often. The more often you take a certain trip, the less tolerance you have for its length, whereas the less often you take it, the longer you're willing to travel.

It's worth noting that you do get some peculiar effects in here. Specifically, commutes to work can sometimes defy this a bit, in that many people will commute to and from work five days a week regardless of how long the commute is. Yet, it's still the case that people who have very long commutes --- say, greater than 30 mi (50 km) --- may choose to commute only several days per week, working from home on other days. At the other end of the spectrum, commuting between multiple jobs in a single day is much more feasible if the jobs are closer together than if they are far apart.

We can also assume that people don't like to spend time

The longer a trip is, the less often a person is to take it, which in turn makes a lower frequency acceptable.


The utility of a transit service for a particular type of trip can be thought of using this formula:

(service frequency ร trip length) รท (trip frequency)

If you hold any two of these variables constant and change the third, you can see how it changes the utility of the transit service. 


What does this mean for transit? A few things:

- In order for transit to the competitive for short-distance trips, it must be frequent, period. The only exception here is for service aimed at people will no alternative, like those who are disabled. For everyone else, walking, biking, and driving are more attractive alternatives.

- When you make transit more frequent, you make it more competitive specifically for shorter-length trips, though it's a benefit for trips of all lengths.

- It's okay for longer-distance transit service to run less frequently. 


This model is a good explanation for commuter rail ridership patterns in many North American cities. In very general sense (with plenty of exceptions!), as you go outward from the city center, both population density and a person's likelihood of working downtown decrease. So you might think that individual station ridership will decrease with distance... yet often the opposite is the case.


you can find a fair number of commuter rail lines where ridership generally increases as you go outward. An commuter rail lines that travel just within city limits tend to have disappointing ridership, while often some of the highest-ridership stations will be at the edge of the system. Why? Simple:

Think of five-times-per-week work commutes on a line with the same frequency throughout its entire length. Refering to our formula above, the remaining variable is trip length; as the trip length increases, so does the utility of this service.
To put this into more concrete terms, let's imagine a line that runs every 30 minutes during peak commute hours.

- For urban service (let's say less than 5 mi/8 km), that's a frequency that's way too low, so most people will elect other modes, like driving or taking some other transit line.
- For service to the far suburbs (let's say over 15 mi/25 km), that's often an acceptable frequency


If you assume frequency is the same for the entire length of the line --- an assumption that isn't always true, but is right often enough that we'll use it here -- 


Specifically, a lot of lines have a peculiar ridership patter

Another interesting effect:
If you look within commuter rail systems in the United States, the lines with the highest ridership tend to be those that double as short intercity lines, with the satellite city stations being some of the busiest in the system. This is because commuter rail frequency in the US is generally bad, which depresses ridership, but it's more tolerable for longer-distance journeys, and that effect is magnified when there's a satellite city at the end of the line (due to the larger number of residents at that end, plus the potential for trips where the satellite city is the destination). Some examples:

- MBTA: The busiest lines are the Providence/Stoughton and Framingham/Worcester lines [double check!]. Providence is the busiest station outside downtown Boston, with Boston's other satellite cities (including Worcester and Lowell) almost among the busiest stations. Meanwhile many of the least-bust stations in the system are inside or very near Boston.
The frequency is adequate for trips to/from Boston's satellie cities, but not good for trips within Boston and its adjacent communities.
- Metro-North
Frequency to Stamford and New Haven is fine... not for the Bronx
- NJT: NEC (Trenton, New Brunswick freq is fine)
NJT isn't the greatest example becasuse of the difficulty of crossing the Hudson (this inflates ridership in the inner suburbs)
- MARC (Penn Line; Baltimore dominates... vs New Carrolton is sad)
- SEPTA (Wilmington, Trenton)
- Metra: Aurora and Naperville?



I don't claim my formula is a perfect explanation for commuter rail ridership patterns, as there are many, many confounding variables. But I do think it helps provide part of the explanation, and the formula is nonetheless a pretty solid principle for transit operations in general.


Add somewhere:
We see this effect with flights too. It's okay for a transcontinental flight to only run once per day, whereas flights between New York and Chicago need to be much more frequent. People take shorter flights more often and longer flights less often, and they're willing to tolerate more inconventient departure times for longer flights because they take those flights less often and the inconvenience is relatively smaller in the context of the trip due to the increased amount of time spent in the air.
