Hello, world!

This is my zeroth (or if you prefer, first) post on this site. This site has been in various states of construction for a while. Major thanks to [Danny Chapman][] for giving me the motivation to scrap my original semblance of a website and start fresh again.

At some point, I will write a post explaining how I got this website up and running on GitHub Pages and Jekyll.
