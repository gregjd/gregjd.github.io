Hello, world!

This is my zeroth (or if you prefer, first) post on this site. This site has been in various states of construction for a while. Major thanks to [Danny Chapman][] for giving me the motivation to scrap my original semblance of a website and start fresh again.

At some point, I will write a post explaining how I got this website up and running on [GitHub Pages][] and [Jekyll][].

This site will continue to change as I make design changes and add content and features. I know I will be adding [DISQUS][] comments to posts, and I may adopt [Bootstrap][].
