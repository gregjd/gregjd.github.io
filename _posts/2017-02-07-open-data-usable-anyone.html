<p>Open data can help you even if you know nothing about data, because it can power tools and resources that are usable by anyone.</p>
<p>This was on clear display recently at <a href="http://transportationcamp.org/" target="_blank">TransportationCamp</a>, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a> that focuses on the intersection of transportation and technology. Several developers from <a href="https://mapzen.com/">Mapzen</a> ran a session presenting some of the open-source mapping tools they&#8217;ve been working on recently.</p>
<p>One in particular, the <a href="https://mapzen.com/mobility/explorer/">Mobility Explorer</a>, allows users to visualize and understand local transportation networks. For example, here&#8217;s a map of all transit lines around Washington, D.C.:</p>
{% include image.html file="mobility-explorer-routes.png" source="https://mapzen.com/mobility/explorer/" alt="A map of all transit routes in the DC metropolitan area, generated by Mobility Explorer" credit="Mapzen" %}
<p>Note that this map is showing routes <em>across multiple transit agencies</em> — this is possible thanks to <a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/2016/06/20/opengov-voices-transit-data-a-major-success-story-for-common-data-standards/">all transit providers using a common data standard for their schedule and route data</a>.</p>
<p>My favorite feature is the isochrone generator. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isochrone_map">Isochrones</a> show you how far you can travel from a given point in a given amount of time. Isochrone maps can be used by businesses, other organizations, and residents to make location decisions — and they can even be considered <a href="http://humantransit.org/2012/11/the-need-for-maps-of-your-freedom.html">maps of your freedom</a>.</p>
<p>For example, here at Sunlight, we were recently deciding on a new office location. One thing we wanted in our office was accessibility to both current and prospective employees who live all over the city and region. Here&#8217;s Mobility Explorer&#8217;s isochrone map for our new office:</p>

<p>The successive color rings show 15-, 30-, 45- and 60-minute travel times on a weekday morning. So this map shows where in the region employees can live and have a reasonable commute time. What if we had instead located ourselves in suburban Tysons Corner? Our isochrone map would look like this:</p>

<p>Our office would be transit-accessible to significantly fewer employees, potentially limiting our hiring pool.</p>
<p>These maps <a href="https://youtu.be/CDL2D2cZ2Ts?t=24m14s">could also help</a> someone who&#8217;s moving to the region decide where to live based on what jobs and other opportunities they&#8217;ll be able to access, or they can tell a prospective business owner what kind of a customer pool would be able to access a given store location. Mobility Explorer can also generate isochrones for driving, biking and walking, and can be produced for any time or day.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: all of these features are powered by open data, but you don&#8217;t need to worry about that data! You don&#8217;t need to know what <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/">GTFS</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSVs</a> are to be able to use these tools.</p>
<p>We definitely need to keep working to make open data <a href="https://sunlightfoundation.com/2017/01/17/opengov-voices-making-open-data-more-accessible-three-lessons-from-boston/">more accessible to the public</a>, but we should also remember that just because the public may not be directly looking at a certain data set, that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not useful or valuable to the public.</p>
<p>Here on Sunlight’s Local team, we’re trying to increasingly focus on open data for <em>impact</em> and not just open data for open data’s sake — so we’re excited to see practical, user-friendly tools that anyone can use, like Mobility Explorer.</p>
