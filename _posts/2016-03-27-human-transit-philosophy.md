title: How reading 'Human Transit' made me a better philosopher

Transit planner Jarrett Walker is the author of the excellent [blog](http://humantransit.org/) and [book](http://humantransit.org/book) _Human Transit_. I've been reading his blog for years, and recently finished the book. Jarrett's writings have had a profound impact on my thinking about transit --- challenging, clarifying, and expanding it. But what has been more surprising is that many of the lessons go far beyond transit; _Human Transit_ has made me a better philosopher in numerous ways:

- Separate arguments
- Language
- Thinking about connections/integration
- (the other things)

(give a summary?)

Let's have a look at some examples.


## Bus versus rail: separating arguments

In [Streetcars: An Inconvenient Truth](http://humantransit.org/2009/07/streetcars-an-inconvenient-truth.html) --- one of the most controversial posts on his site --- Jarrett asserts that _"Streetcars that replace bus lines are not a mobility or access improvement."_ Rather, many of the improvements we associate with streetcars are actually mode-neutral and could have been implemented with buses; those that are intrinsic to streetcars

and another)

(He is sure to mention that rail and bus technologies have advantages and disadvantages that make one or the other better suited for different situations)



In [Rail-Bus Differences: Premise or Conclusion?](http://humantransit.org/2011/03/rail-bus-differences-contd.html), Jarrett expands upon an urban transit right-of-way [classification scheme](http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c05/e6-40-02-02.pdf) developed by transit expert [Vukan Vuchic](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~vuchic/), in which there are three classes:

- Class A: "Exclusive right-of-way and separated from cross traffic"
- Class B: "Exclusive right-of-way, NOT separated from cross traffic"
- Class C: "Mixed with traffic, including mixed with pedestrians"

He includes this figure in Chapter 8 of his book:

![Diagram of right-of-way classes A, B, and C](/images/HumanTransit_ClassABC.jpg)

The type of right-of-way --- not to mention the choice of local, rapid, or express service --- is independent from the selection of bus or rail technology.

This relates to the computer science concept of [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns), as well as the general philosophical principle of treating logically separate arguments as separate.


## Lines vs. routes: using the right words

In a [fascinating post](http://humantransit.org/2011/02/watching-our-words-route-or-line.html) about the use of language --- particularly regarding the words _route_ and _line_ --- Jarrett notes:

> Most of the words used in transit discussions also have a more common meaning outside that context. That common meaning often forms a connotation that hangs around the word, often causing confusion, when we use the word to talk about transit. In saying the word, we may intend only the transit meaning, but some people may be hearing the more common meaning. Regardless of our intentions, the commonplace meaning of a word is often still there, as a connotation, when the word’s used in a transit context.

He continues:

> A _route_, in its common meaning, is the path traced by some kind of person or vehicle. When a package or message is going through a postal system, we say it’s being routed. The person who delivers newspapers to subscribers in the morning is following a paper route. School buses typically follow routes. What these meanings of route have in common is that the route isn’t necessarily followed very often.

On the other hand, a _line_ "is a thing that’s just there, no matter what happens along it." It raises expectations of frequency and reliability relative to the word _route_. What's really interesting is the unconcious biases present at transit agencies and in everyday conversation; we nearly always talk about "rail lines" and "bus routes" --- thus tying an expectation about service to a technology.

Jarrett also advocates using the word "connection" over "transfer." While I don't feel as strongly about this issue as he does, you should still check out [his argument](http://humantransit.org/2009/04/unhelpful-word-watch-to-transfer.html).

Furthermore, he [advises](http://humantransit.org/2013/07/slippery-word-watch-commute.html) watching the use of the words "commute" and "commuter." And [his post](http://humantransit.org/2014/01/questionable-word-watch-urbanism.html) on the words "urban" and "urbanism" was a piece of the inspiration for [my post](www.gregjd.com/blog/2016/03/27/what-does-urban-mean/) on those words.

Jarrett partially [attributes](http://humantransit.org/2010/02/how-do-i-become-a-transit-planner.html#comment-80190) his attention to language to his educational background: "I spent my teens and thirties obsessing about transit but I spent my twenties obsessing about the arts, doing a PhD in an arts/literature/humanities field at Stanford. It’s why I’m obsessed with words, and tend to notice how the language we use uses us."
