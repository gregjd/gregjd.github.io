Hi!

{{ site.description }} I currently work as the Open Cities Technologist at the Sunlight Foundation in DC.

The main types of things I like doing — especially when applied to the list of topics below — include:

- **Analyzing data** to gain useful and interesting insights
- **Building software and web tools** that help people get things done
- **Communicating information** through maps, diagrams, charts, and words
- **Designing user experiences** that are intuitive and elegant

I've done these things both through work and in my personal time, and am always looking for new challenges.

The main topics I'm interested in are:

- **Government that works for people** in a way that is effective, efficient, responsive, and transparent
- **Transportation networks** that make it easy for people to get around without a car
- **Human-centered cities** that are livable, happy, and prosperous
- **Parks and public lands** that let people experience the great outdoors

That's not an exhaustive list. Other topics of interest include:

- Organizational structure and management
- Curriculum design
- Obscure geographic trivia
- National and homeland security
- Energy and natural resources
- Typography
