Hello!

{{ site.description }}

## Experience

I currently work as Strategy & Design Lead for the Open Cities Team of the [What Works Cities](https://whatworkscities.bloomberg.org/) initiative, on a contract for [Results for America](https://results4america.org/). This is a continuation of work I did at the Sunlight Foundation for almost four years, most recently as Open Cities Product Lead. Our team at Sunlight/RFA has been focused on helping local governments improve community access to open data.

I have worked in a variety of roles that have given me firsthand experience in a range of areas — including data analysis, web development, visual design, and UX research — and a lot of my work now focuses on developing strategy, leading engagements with government partners, and training government staff. Along the way, I have gained significant policy knowledge in open data, government technology, procurement, and local governance.

Outside of work, I have been an active volunteer in the civic-technology community. I got my start at [Code Island](http://code-island.org/) in Providence, and am now co-director of [Code for DC](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-DC/).

## Interests

Some of the topics I'm passionate about are:

- **Government that works for people** in a way that is effective, efficient, responsive, and transparent
- **Human-centered cities** that are livable, happy, and prosperous
- **Transportation networks** that make it easy for people to get around without a car
- **Parks and public lands** that let people experience the great outdoors

I'm also very interested in learning new languages — to be able to connect with people and cultures around the world, to help with travel, and just for the challenge. I'm currently focused on **Spanish** and **Japanese**, and am also interested in French, Russian, Portuguese, Italian, and Polish… but I would love to learn bits of many other languages!

<!-- The main types of things I like doing — especially when applied to the list of topics below — include:

- **Communicating information** through maps, diagrams, charts, and words
- **Developing websites and web tools** that help people get things done
- **Analyzing data** to gain useful and interesting insights
- **Designing user experiences** that are intuitive and elegant

I've done these things both through work and in my personal time, and am always looking for new challenges. -->

<!-- That's not an exhaustive list. Other topics of interest include:

- Organizational structure and management
- Language learning
- Obscure geographic trivia
- Landscape architecture
- Curriculum design
- National and homeland security
- Energy and natural resources
- Typography -->
