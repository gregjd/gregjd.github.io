Hi!

I'm Greg, a developer and designer living in Providence.

I work at [DataSpark](http://datasparkri.org/), where my work is primarily in data analysis, mapping, and design. I am also a part-time instructor at [Mathnasium of East Providence](http://www.mathnasium.com/eastprovidence), where I provide tutoring for students in grades 1-12. I am involved in [Code Island](http://code-island.org/), Code for America's Rhode Island brigade. I graduated Brown University in May 2014 with a double major in Urban Studies and Geological Sciences.

My intellectual interests broadly fall in three areas: geography, design, and computation.

* **Geography:** For a long time, people asked what the connection was between my majors in Urban Studies and Geological Sciences, and I usually replied that I didn't really see one and was literally just interested in both. But I eventually [came to realize](http://www.brown.edu/academics/urban-studies/sites/brown.edu.academics.urban-studies/files/uploads/2014%20Urban%20Studies%20Newsletter_0.pdf#page=2) that in fact there was a very deep connection, which was that they both study the world around us, with one focusing on the built and social environments and the other on the natural environment. Really, I was interested in the full breadth of geography, which has traditionally been divided into human geography and physical geography --- more or less covering my interests urban studies and geoscience. I'm also very interested in cartography and [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system), which are critical in studying all branches of geography. I have loved maps since before elementary school, and took three college GIS courses while in high school. 

* **Design:** I think about design in a human-centered and minimal way that balances elegance with practicality. I enjoy abstraction and "design thinking," focusing on principles that are widely applicable. To me, there truly are relationships between disparate-seeming fields like transit system design, curriculum design, and typography. Other interests include graphic design, data visualization, algorithm design, writing style, and urban design.

* **Computation:** One of the biggest surprises of college was falling in love with computer science and computation. It started with a programming class aimed at social sciences and humanities students, and blossomed from there. Moving beyond basic programming, I found fascination in algorithms and topics like graph theory. Over the past few months, I have gained a deep interest in functional programming, and am currently interested in learning Clojure and Haskell. Functional programming has changed my way of thinking and furthered my interest in theoretical CS as well as pure math. My experience as a math tutor has also really helped me think about how to explain computational concepts to others and apply CS concepts to basic math. Beyond CS and math, I enjoy data analysis, and always ready to make pivot tables and multiply matricies.


In terms of practical applications, I am most interested in civic technology, transportation, planning, open data, and government innovation.
