National parks, monuments, forests, and wildlife refuges: what's what?
A primer on the four federal land-management agencies

National parks, monuments, forests, and wildlife refuges: oh my!
What are they, and who manages them? A primer on federal land management.

The difference between national parks, forests, wildlife refuges, and other public lands


[SUMMARY]


If, like me, you enjoy the outdoors, then you may have heard of many types of land with "National" in the name. What do they all mean? [In many cases, these names tell you more about which agency manages them than what characteristics they have.]

I will answer these questions and more in this primer on land management in the US.

There are four primary land-management agencies in the US federal government: the **Bureau of Land Management** (managing 247 million acres), the **United States Forest Service** (193 m.a.), the **United States Fish and Wildlife Service** (89 m.a.), and the **National Park Service** (80 m.a.). Note that while the National Park Service is the most famous, it actually manages the smallest amount of land.

All of the agencies are part of the Department of the Interior — except the Forest Service, which lies in the Department of Agriculture. (The US Government Accountability Office has [studied]() the idea of moving the Forest Service to Interior.)

The key distinction between these agencies is their mission. The Fish and Wildlife Service's primary focus is on preserving lands for animals and plants (?). The Park Service's dual mission is "to preserve unique resources and to provide for their enjoyment by the public." (check quote) Meanwhile, the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have a *multiple-use mission*. This means that land is explicitly supposed to be used not only for conservation and recreation but also mining, oil and gas drilling, logging, cattle grazing, and renewable-energy production. These extractive uses are managed using [sustainable-yield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_yield) principles. While the FS and BLM have much in common, they have very different origins and structures.

![GAO map]()

I will now discuss each agency in detail, followed by descriptions of land types that span agencies and some useful information if you want to visit federal lands.

# How lands are structured:

(add wikipedia links to each system)

## National Park Service (NPS)

The NPS manages the *National Park System*. Despite the name, this system is more than just the 59 National Parks — it has over 400 units of over 30 different types, with the most common types including National Monuments, National Historic Sites, National Historical Parks, National Seashores, National Memorials, National Recreation Areas, National Preserves. They also manage the National Mall and Memorial Parks.[See the DOI's/CRS's explainer here?]

*National Parks* and *National Monuments* are, for all intents and purposes, the same. They are the most restrictive; they ban off-road vehicle use and generally do not allow hunting (with a few exceptions).

Most NPS-managed *National Recreations Areas* either surround reservoirs (and focus on water-based recreation) or are located in urban areas. For NRAs and *National Preserves*, *National Seashores*, *National Lakeshores*, and similarly designated units, regulations vary by unit, but many permit more activities than National Parks and NPS-managed National Monuments, often including hunting and off-road vehicle use. A small number of units permit oil and gas exploration.
(re-word that sentence)

No, the units designated as National Parks are *not* considered by the NPS to be any more special than other units — that's a notion perpetuated by the public and the media. Under federal law _______, all 400+ units are considered equals.  

About two-thirds of the NPS's land lies in Alaska.



## United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS, USFWS)

The FWS manages the *National Wildlife Refuge System*. Most units are designated as *National Wildlife Refuges*, but some go by other names, like the Patuxent Research Refuge and National Elk Refuge. National Wildlife Refuges are intended to ____
6 activities

Most FWS land (86%) is located in Alaska. In the rest of the US, most refuges are located in wetlands, many of them in coastal areas. In addition to land, the FWS also manages several [*Marine National Monuments*]().



## United States Forest Service (FS, USFS)

The FS manages the *National Forest System*, which includes *National Forests* and *National Grasslands*. The FS also has land designated as National Monuments and National Recreation Areas, but these are *overlays* on existing National Forests, not independent units (as is the case for the NPS). Each National Forest/Grassland is divided into *ranger districts*.

Each Forest/Grassland has an "authorized purchase boundary" (check term) that marks the land the FS is authorized to purchase. In the East, many Forests were established after regional settlement, and thus the FS lands were assembled by buying private land. This results in a large number of "private inholdings," which are area of private property within authorized purchase boundaries. ![Map of private inholdings]() (So when you see a map with large, contiguous National Forest areas, that's generally an overstatement of FS land holdings.) In the West, many Forests and Grasslands were created directly out of land held by the federal government, and as a result, western units tend to have few private inholdings.
[cite percents?]

The FS is the only one of the four land-management agencies that owns a significant amount of land in the eastern US. Thus, for many Americans, it's the only agency with large tracts of land near them. New Hampshire's White Mountain(s) National Forest is reportedly the most-visited unit of federal land east of the Mississippi River. [source?]

manages a majority federal lands in the East



## Bureau of Land Management (BLM)

The BLM manages the *National System of Public Lands*. They also manage about 700 million acres of underground mineral rights on all federal lands, not just itheir own. ![Map of surface holdings? or refer to map above]()

The very idea of land ownership and naming at the BLM is fundamentally different from the NPS, FWS, and FS.
The other agencies are defined by land that *was* specifically set aside, but the BLM's land is land that generally *wasn't* — the "leftovers" that were inherited from the [General Land Office](). Federal policy used to focus on disposing of this land, but over time, the focus shifted away from disposing of federal lands and toward keeping them. This culminated with the [Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Land_Policy_and_Management_Act_of_1976), which effectively ended [homesteading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_Acts).

As a result, *much of the BLM's land is desert, shrubland, and tundra*, because areas with more hospitable climates and more water were more attractive for human settlement and agriculture, while forests were more likely to be included in the National Forest System. (Compare the land-management map above with a [map of land biomes in the US]()!) Also, as a result of partial disposal of lands, BLM land often has a "checkerboard pattern"  ![Map of "checkerboard" land ownership pattern]()
[see if I can find a good website about checkerboard]
In fact, the basic notion that all BLM lands constitute one system is quite new; the "National System of Public Lands" name was only created in [2008/9]().

Instead of administering land as largely contiguous, discrete units — as is the case for the other agencies — the BLM divides the entire country into areas managed by *state offices*, which are responsible for all BLM lands (plus all federal mineral rights) within their borders. This has several consequences:

- By default, BLM land is not named. It is simply land managed by the such-and-such field office of the so-and-so state office of the BLM.
- BLM lands generally do not have entrance signs like those for the other agencies' lands.
- Most the BLM's public-facing resources, like websites and social media accounts, come from the state offices and not specific land units.
- Every point in the US falls within the borders of some BLM office.

The BLM has a very clear two-tiered treatment of lands: while much of the BLM's land is name-less and intended for multiple uses, the [*National Landscape Conservation System*]() represents lands intended primarily for conservation and related uses. These units have a variety of names, including *National Conservation Area*, *National Monument*, and *Outstanding Natural Area*. The BLM places a heavy public marketing focus on these lands, and these units generally have entrance sings.



# For the visitor:

entrance fees - more common NPS
National Forests/Grasslands and BLM lands generally do not charge admission fees, though some specific day-use recreation areas do.
freedom of use
camping
availablity of information



# Land designations that span agencies:

## National Monuments

[Link to wiki]()

Some sort of protection

Regulations vary by agency. For example, BLM and FS monuments usually allow sport hunting while NPS monuments generally do not.

Antiquities Act

I will further explore the nuances of National Monuments in a future post.


## National Wilderness Preservation System

[National Wilderness Preservation System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Wilderness_Preservation_System)
Wilderness Act

Sometimes called "Capital 'W' Wilderness" (to distinguish it from generic notions of "wilderness")

The BLM has the authority to create *Wilderness Study Areas*, which carry similar protections to Wilderness and are intended to be temporary while officials study the area to determine whether or not to recommend it for permanent Wilderness protection.


## National Wild and Scenic Rivers System

The [National Wild and Scenic Rivers System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Wild_and_Scenic_Rivers_System) consists of free-flowing rivers recognized for their wild, scenic, or recreational nature. Designation as such provides some level of protection against the creation of dams and alteration of riverbanks and channels. Each river is managed by one of the four land-management agencies or by a state government. Inclusion in the system does not necessariy imply land ownership on behalf of the managing agency, and private property rights continue to exist.

## National Trails System

The [National Trails System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trails_System) consists of a number of long-distance trails — the most famous being the Appalachian Trail — that are so designated by the federal government for their scenic, historic, or recreational value. Each is administered by the NPS, FS, or BLM, which typically doesn't own all of the land along the trail but instead works in partnership with a variety landowners and organizations.

cut this? (or just include first sentence)

It should be noted that land management is not the *only* activity of the land management agencies. They all have other roles too, including but not limited to:

- BLM: Managing the Public Land Survey System and owning underground mineral rights on *all* federal lands (not just its own)
- FS: Forest assistance?
- FWS: Duck Stamp, fish hatcheries, <other stuff>, marine national monuments
- NPS: Managing the National Register of Historic Places, National Natural Landmarks System (both of which involve non-NPS land), Natural Heritage Areas

But the BLM also has broader land-acquisition authority
The other three agencies have significant limits [link to CRS report] on what lands then can acquire and dispose of.


I know very few people who have heard of the BLM — which is a shame, because they have so much beautiful land! (See their Instagram feed and Tumblr.)

Material for post on national monuments:


Or perhaps you've heard of all the new National Monuments that President Obama has created and wondered, "Just what *is* a National Monument, and who manages them?"


Monuments that span agencies are *not* a single organizational unit. For example, in the several National Monuments that include both BLM and FS land, the two parts are administered separately

NPS monuments represent an entire unit of NPS-owned land. FS monuments are overlays on one or more National Forests and are generally surrounded by non-monument FS lands; if a monument spans forests, the land is generally administered separately at the forest level, not jointly at the monument level.

On the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service, President Obama [created]() Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine. Many media outlets mistakenly reported on the controversey surrounding this designation as if it was similar to those in the West; in fact, there was an enormous difference – monuments created in the West in recent decades have represented new levels of protection on *existing federal lands*, while Katahdin consists of *private property* that was donated to the federal government for the purpose of creating the monument.


Many are created as politically expedient ways to conserve land (see: Basin and Range in Nevada, to stop Yucca Mountain)


NPS: Monuments vs. Parks (no difference)


BLM
Look at socal - ppl wanted monuments for the name
It looks to me like a big part of the push for new national monuments on BLM land is a desire to put the land "on the map."
From a psychological and public-perception perspective, creating a National Monument on BLM land carries more significance than creating one on FS land because it literally means "putting a place on the map" in a way that isn't as true for land already designated as part of a National Forest.

What's the best way to preserve land?

By far the best way to preserve land and guard it against environmental damage is to give it federal wilderness designation — or as some call it, "Wilderness with a capital W." This prevents _______
And if the land in question
Transferring land to the National Park Service is nearly guaranteed to raise its prominence.

I often hear people clamor that we should create national parks out of BLM and FS land as a way of protecting it. I, too, used to hold that view. Alas, not so fast!

Designating land as a national park is generally a terrible way to preserve it. It raises its prominence.




I have a lot of opinions about federal land management. Far and away the biggest is that the Forest Service should move to the Department of the Interior.
