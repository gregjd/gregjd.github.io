# What counts as a "city government"? It's complicated




In my work on the [What Works Cities]() program — which works with city governments around the United States — I frequently encounter people who are looking for a set of governments that are "cities but not counties."

On a national scale, there's no such thing! Or if there is, it's difficult to define and involves splitting hairs.

(ALSO need to link to my post about urbanism, and touch on that issue. Mention issue of Vegas strip not being in Vegas!)


## Stereotypical picture

"Cities are a sub-county level of government."

States are divided up into counties (called Parrishes in Louisiana and Boroughs in Alaska)



## Not so fast!


Maryland

Maryland has one of the smallest numbers of local non-county governments in the country. This is because Maryland counties are quite powerful.

MoCo

Baltimore!



Virginia

So... Baltimore City is a county-equivalent government that's called a "City" instead of a "County" and is separate from Baltimore County.

Yet Virginia has county governments, county-equivalent governments called "Cities," and counties with "City" in the name.



Durham (proposal and current)


## Don't forget New England

Rhode Island

In Rhode Island, there are two types of local governments: cities and towns. They do not overlap, and all areas of the state are part of one. There are no county governments or unincorporated areas. There's a similar situation in other New England states — little to no county government and few if any unincorporated areas.


So wait a second. In both Virginia and Rhode Island, the


(Somehwere: MoCo and Fairfax are two of the largest urban municipal governments in the country, a product of their raw population plus being the primary local government)

## Bias

Part of why many people I know are not familiar with the nuances of all of this is that many of the cities where such people hail from don't really deal with counties.

Here's why:
- *Boston, Providence, and elsewhere in New England:* There's little to no county government, with cities and towns assuming all local-government functions.
- *New York City:* The city covers five counties, and manages the local services for all of them. The five counties are also coterminous with the city's five boroughs, so to the extent that governing structures exist for the counties, they are often thought of as being for the boroughs.
- *Philadelphia:* It's a consolidated city-county.
- *Baltimore:* It's an independent city / county-equivalent city government, and it has "city" in the name.
- *Washington, DC:* You know.
- *San Francisco:*
- *Denver:*
People in these places don't hear much about county government.
(Note that this is a "specific city" bias, not a "C")

But talk to someone from Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix, or Las Vegas — counties are a big deal there!

## Full list

*Coterminous consolidated cities/counties:*

Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Anchorage.

*Non-coterminous "consolidated" cities/counties*

Some of the most commonly cited examples here are Nashville, Indianapolis, and Louisville.

If you ask me, a better way of describing these places is that the city government dissolved/disincorporated and its functions were assumed by the county government, which then started branding itself using the former central city's name. But I'm sure someone more familiar with the nuances would beg to differ.


NYC

DC



In some states, cities must be contained within a single county, while in others they can cross county lines.


Also: can a "town" count as a city government?

Judging by whether the name has "city" or "county" in it is incredibly shallow and clearly incorrect.
If you want the Nashville city government, there isn't one.

(Mention shoewhere: Las Vegas Metro police, other cases where city functions are done by independent bodies)


## What's the point?

If you found this post enlightening, good — I hope I was able to shed light on some nuances.

If you found this post confusing, good — one of the key points here is that the structure of local government in the United States is really complicated, and there truly is no

You often *can* make this distinction within a state. But not nationally.
One of the consequences of our system of federalism is that states are free to come up with whatever variety of local-government structures they want. And they do.
