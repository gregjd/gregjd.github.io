The seven types of transit
------



National Rail
	Long Distance
	Higher Speed
	High Speed
Corridor Rail
Regional Rail
Rapid Transit
	Rail Rapid Transit
	Light Rail Transit
	Bus Rapid Transit
Core Service
Local Service (?)
Circulator Service (?)





If Corridor Rail, Regional Rail, and Core Service sound foreign, that's because they are --- there are few examples of them in the United States, though those that do exist are often quite successful.


Other types of transit that exist but aren't on my list:
Commuter Service!
Tourist Service (Historic, Downtown Loop)  - _____ Often times, the technology is integral to 
Intercity Bus Service
Ferry Service

Other modes:
Incline/Monorail Service
Tram-Train


There are really two axes here:
local services (coverage vs. ridership) - Jarrett Walker
rail services (local vs. intercity) - Alon Levy


Problem with American transit:
- We focus on the wrong things, so you can't even see how these fit in
- On the transit side, too infrequent
- On the rail side, there's a huge gap betwen subways, commuter, and national


The biggest places we can differentiate:
- GTFS
- Transit agency terminology, maps, signage


How this applies to German transit:

National Rail - InterCity Express, Thalys, EuroNight
Corridor Rail - InterCity, Regional Express (?)
Regional Rail - Regional Bahn, S-Bahn
Rapid Transit - U-Bahn, Stadtbahn
Other - Bus, Tram (Strassenbahn)

Similar concepts exist in some adjacent countries, like Switzerland, Austria, and the Netherlands. (confirm)

US Examples::

Boston:
National - Amtrak
Commuter - Commuter Rail, Ferry, Express Bus?
Rapid Transit - Red Line, Green Line, Orange Line, Blue Line


San Francisco:
Circulator - 30 minutes or less
Local - 20 minutes or less
Core - 10 minutes or less (incl. Rapid)
Rapid Transit - Muni Metro



Philadelphia:



The actual frequencies of these routes will vary by city. In many of the cities Jarett talks about, the headway cutoffs are 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes. In some dense cities (like San Francisco and New York), a higher standard can be used, like 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes. Regardless, they still represent the same concepts and three distinct categories of service.





Most of these seven categories are sufficiently broad that they can be used to fulfill the functions of the adjacent categories. Let's have a look at rapid transit. Realitically, it's not going to exist everywhere. How do you fill in the gaps? Use one of the adjacent service categories: Core Services or Regional Rail. The Regional Rail approach is common in Germany, where S-Bahn services often provide rapid transit-like service in areas without U-Bahn access. (For another example, in Paris, RER Line B provides rapid transit in areas south of the city center that have no Metro service.)


Transit systems usually don't have the resources to operate every type of service on every corridor, and in any case, it's not particularly useful for a corridor to have two services with only a slight difference between them, unless they are intended to serve different markets (like with Muni Metro and BART on Market Street in San Francisco), or there's an overwhelming amount of demand (like with Paris Metro lines 1 and 14 and RER Line A).







When faced with the inconvenient truth that transit's utility is primarily dependent on service and not technology, a lot of people become defensive and point out that in fact bus and rail are different. And they're right, sort of. In the United States today, in most transit systems that have bus service and rail rapid transit service, there's a significant service difference between the two. If you refer to my figure above, that's because there's a large chasm between them. High-quality bus lines are rare, as are low-quality rail lines (excluding commuter rail). This is changing somewhat, with the development of both better-than-what-we're-used-to bus lines and worse-than-rapid-transit rail service (i.e. mixed-traffic streetcars [link]). As these trends continue

(Streetcars are a whole separate can of worms, as the whole point behind them is usually to be branded as different from regular buses. People who advocated for such project on the basis of economic development are not eager to see streetcars' marketed importance reduced.)


This is an opportunity to fundamentally change the conversation 

as much as I've praised certain European countries, the reality is that many that have all these types of services still brand them on a mode basis. For example, Paris, which has a fantatic bus system that largely qualifies as Core, still uses "Bus" as its marketing term.




It's not enough for individual cities to have a branding for this idea (core network). We need terms that are nationally or even globally understandable, like Germany's railway categories.

The only nationally/globally understood terms we have are ones that focus on technology. We need 




Why people like subways
-------


They represent the pinnacle of urban transit


(When saying "light rail," I'm excluding streetcar services)

The actual service provided by most light rail lines is nearly equivalent to that provided by subway lines --- in terms of frequency, speed, reliability, simplicity, _____






Clockface, please!

For contrast, check out the new map for San Francisco transit:


As Jarett Walker pointed out in [his post], the beauty of this map is _not_ up close --- though it's great at that level too --- but rather that you can see the structure of the system at a faraway glance, due to line thickness based on frequency (and red color for faster Rapid and Metro lines). This is the kind of service-based understanding that we need to move toward.




Reinforces
SEPTA's "everything that runs on rails" map. Most of the map is taken up by Regional Rail lines, most of which run once an hour off-peak are nearly useless for intra-city transit (despite the fact that several of them operate entirely within the city).




This post or the other one?

Problematic - _"enhanced bus" or "train on wheels"
basically casts the term "bus" (without qualification) as synonymous with a low quality of service.
