Writing tips I learned from working on a college newspaper
=====

Much more useful than any class I took

Combination of:
- Training
- Editing sessions
- Tim Harrower's book(s)

### People won't read all of what you write

Unless it's really short.

### People read headlines, headings, and bullet points

### Put the information first

[tweet example]

Inverted pyramid

Common issue with quotes

### Don't waste words

Less is more

[Tufte: dataâ€“ink ratio]

### Yes, you can write short headlines

Almost all news items can be headlined in 7 words or less, and nearly anything can be headlined in 13 words or less.

### Images and graphics draw people into text

Points of entry
Avoid walls of text

### Write short paragraphs

### Great design can't fix bad content

**Somewhere:** focus on writing/editing what matters (headlines, subheadings, ledes)
In life: focus on executive summary/abstract
