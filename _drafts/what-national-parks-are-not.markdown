Does it deserve to be a national park?

People say "I love the national parks"


What I've noticed 
People seem to have a stereotype of what constitutes a national park that simply isn't true for many parks

Stereotypical characteristics:
- They're big
- They largely protect natural environments / don't have significant human alteration
- They have spectacular scenery
- They're not in urban areas
- They have visitor centers
- They have trails
- They have campgrounds
- They have lodges and restaurants
- Their land is owned by the National Park Service


Each of these characteristics has multiple parks that are missing them — including some famous ones! — and there are some parks that are even missing most of them
(Yes, there are parks with no visitor center.)


The "big three":
- Yellowstone
- Yosemite
- Grand Canyon

Other "major" (10)
- Glacier
- Grand Teton
- Zion
- Bryce Canyon
- Great Smoky Mountains
- Olympic
- Mount Rainier
- Crater Lake
- Rocky Mountain
- Mesa Verde

More other (12)
(These are either lacking some things or less famous, but I still think it's fair to say they broadly fit into the national park stereotype) (Don't fit all aspects of the stereotype, but are still famous, or fit all the aspects of the stereotype but aren't as well known)
- Arches
- Canyonlands
- Acadia
- Shenandoah
- Big Bend
- Everglades
- Redwood
- Joshua Tree
- Sequoia (and Kings Canyon)
- Death Valley
- Hawaii Volcanoes

But what about the rest?

Examples of what you wouldn't expect: (9)
- Hot Springs
- Cuyahoga Valley (sp?)
- Dry Tortugas
- Biscayne
- North Cascades
- Wind Cave
- Congaree
- Great Sand Dunes
- American Samoa

- Gates of the Arctic, or something else in Alaska (8)
>> Add Denali or Glacier Bay to the earlier lists?

Not listed (18?): Mammoth Cave, Guadalupe Mountains, Carlsbad Caverns, Great Basin, Lassen Volcanic, Badlands, Theodore Roosevelt, Voyageurs, Isle Royale, Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Capitol Reef, Petrified Forest, Pinnacles, Saguaro, Haleakala, Channel Islands, Virgin Islands



Random talent - I can name all 59 off the top of my head, and put them all on a map


Part of me agrees that the term should be more restrictive. But let's be real here — since a good chunk of the parks don't fit that definition (and this has been the case for decades... it's not like this is a recent expansion of the term), there's no going back. Also, what else would you call these parks?


The main points:
- The units that got the name "national park" are incredibly arbitrary
- Many of them are nothing like the stereotype
- Given those two things, it's silly to protest other units being renamed as "national parks"

By the way...
There are NPS units that fit many of the stereotypes but are not designated as national parks. Why not designate them as such?

Examples to save for the next post:
- Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area
- Mojave National Preserve
- Lava Beds National Monument
- Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument?
- Lake Mead National Recreation Area
