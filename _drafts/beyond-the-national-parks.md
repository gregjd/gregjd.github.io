Could possibly go in post somewhere:
Many people say that [Pinnacles National Park]() is the "newest national park." That's not wrong per se; of the 59 units with "National Park" in the name, sure, it's the one that most recently got that name. But it's actually one of the _oldest_ units of the National Park System. It was established in 1908 — _before_ the National Park Service even existed! A few years ago, it was renamed from Pinnacles National Monument to Pinnacles National Park, but its beauty and spectacle have always been there.

### Separate post: Overrated National Parks

"Overrated" and/or not what you might have expected

Is this worth writing a post about? Probably not for a while

- Cuyahoga Valley
- Hot Springs (should be Historical)
- Shenandoah
- Guadalupe Mountains
- Congaree


### Separate post: Shenandoah is overrated / Shenandoah isn't very special (warning: hot take!)
(But I still go there!)

- It's a bunch of the same
  - Lots of trees
  - Some waterfalls
  - The hikes are mostly the same: either up (usually to a summit) or down (often to a waterfall or stream)
  - Big Meadows is one of the only distinct features
- It's not remarkably scenic
  - Don't get me wrong. The mountains are pretty.
  - But it's nothing to write home about. It doesn't protect anything particularly unique or outstanding.

Let's remember how it came about. It wasn't protected for it's specialness, it was protected because there was a "Virginia needs a national park" campaign, and there was significant intervention to make it into a park (building Skyline Drive, etc.)

Most parks: nice place -> let's make it a park

Shenandoah: let's make a park -> where should we put it? -> here

It's *nice*. It's just not very special. Don't travel across the county to see it. It doesn't remotely compare to many of the other parks.


BUT — it's still a nice place, I still like going there, and I will continue to go there for as long as I live in the DC area. It satisfices.


### Separate post: Should 'National Park' be a broad or narrow term?

http://www.npr.org/2016/08/09/489190190/in-oklahoma-a-national-park-that-got-demoted

I'd argue broad (because: list reasons)

We already crossed that bridge. _The term "National Park" hasn't meant "stuff like Yellowstone" for over a century!_
- Sullys Hill National Park
- Platt National Park
- Numerous others: General Grant, Mackinac, Fort McHenry, Abraham Lincoln

But also, many of our current parks violate some of the 'classic attributes' that we think of.
