# Getting to know mid-sized US cities


## Cleveland

I had the pleasure of visiting Cleveland twice in the span of a month.

Industrial

Grand - lots of institutions

Very wide streets

## Pittsburgh

Industrial

## Baltimore

Other parts too

Rowhouses

## Sacramento

I tell people that it reminded me of Denver with notes of Portland.
